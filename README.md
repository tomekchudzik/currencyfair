The aim of this design is to have a scalable distributed system.  This implementation uses Hazelcast distributed cache. It allows to have trade consumption endpoints and trade processing distributed across the cluster. 
-	This is a self-contained implementation that runs all the components in one process.
-	It doesnâ€™t provide durable storage for trades , it runs on in-memory cache 
-	Project runs on spring boot framework 
-	It uses and non-blocking rest endpoint to consume trades
-	Frontend simply renders a couple of statistics and uses websocket 
To run application use maven goal: spring-boot:run
